Day 14: Benchmarking Matrix Multiplication Performance
Concept: Benchmarking helps you understand the performance impact of your optimizations. Day 14 compares the performance of the basic (Day 11), tiled (Day 12), and coalesced (Day 13) matrix multiplication implementations in CUDA, and contrasts them with PyTorch's optimized torch.matmul.
